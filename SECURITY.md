## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security concerns that impact repos under the [`APIs-guru` GitHub org](https://github.com/APIs-guru/) via [maintainers@apis.guru](mailto:maintainers@apis.guru).

Our goal is to provide complete, accurate, and actionable disclosures once a reported issue has been sufficiently understood and there has been a reasonable opportunity to deploy fixes.
